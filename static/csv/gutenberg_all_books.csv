Letter 1To Mrs. Saville, England.St. Petersburgh, Dec. 11th, 17—.You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of
an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrived
here yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and
increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh,
I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and
fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze, which has
travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste
of those icy climes. Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become
more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat
of frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its
broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour.
There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding
navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we
may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region
hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be
without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in
those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal
light? I may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and
may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to
render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my
ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited,
and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my
enticements, and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and
to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when
he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of
discovery up his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false,
you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind,
to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those
countries, to reach which at present so many months are requisite; or by
ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be
effected by an undertaking such as mine.These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter,
and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven, for
nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purpose—a
point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye. This expedition has been
the favourite dream of my early years. I have read with ardour the accounts of
the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the
North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole. You may remember
that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
whole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected, yet I was
passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study day and night, and my
familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt, as a child, on
learning that my father’s dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me
to embark in a seafaring life.These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whose
effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet and
for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I also
might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are
consecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the
disappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and
my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, even
now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.
I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers on
several expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine,
thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors during
the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of
medicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer
might derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as
an under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I must
own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the
vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuable
did he consider my services.And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? My
life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to every
enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice would
answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes
fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long
and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I
am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain
my own, when theirs are failing.This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly quickly
over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in my opinion, far
more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The cold is not excessive,
if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have already adopted, for there is a
great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for
hours, when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your
veins. I have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St.
Petersburgh and Archangel.I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my
intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the
insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary
among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sail
until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can I
answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will pass
before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.Farewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you, and
save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and
kindness.Your affectionate brother,R. Walton

CONTENTS1. INTRODUCTION2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR4. TOOLS, TARGETS, AND TIMING5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE
1. INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage, to outline its
possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it.Sabotage varies from highly technicalcoup de mainacts that require
detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives, to innumerable
simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This
paper is primarily concerned with the latter type. Simple sabotage does not
require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary
citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for
active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way
as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal.Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the citizen-saboteur are salt,
nails, candles, pebbles, thread, or any other materials he might normally be
expected to possess as a householder or as a worker in his particular
occupation. His arsenal is the kitchen shelf, the trash pile, his own usual kit
of tools and supplies. The targets of his sabotage are usually objects to which
he has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life.A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and
produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on
universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a noncooperative
attitude, and to induce others to follow suit. Making a faulty decision may be
simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A
non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant
situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or
displaying surliness and stupidity.This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the “human
element,” is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general
obstruction even under normal conditions. The potential saboteur should
discover what types of faulty decisions and the operations arenormallyfound in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge
that “margin for error.”

2. POSSIBLE EFFECTSActs of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe. An effort should be
made to add to their efficiency, lessen their detectability, and increase their
number. Acts of simple sabotage, multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs,
can be an effective weapon against the enemy. Slashing tires, draining fuel
tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting
electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and
time. Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and
tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy.Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value.
Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy
administrators and police. Further, success may embolden the citizen-saboteur
eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater
dimensions. Finally, the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy
or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively
with the United Nations war effort, and encourage them to assist openly in
periods of Allied invasion and occupation.

3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEURTo incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him
practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem.Simple sabotage is often an act which the citizen performs according to his own
initiative and inclination. Acts of destruction do not bring him any personal
gain and may be completely foreign to his habitually conservationist attitude
toward materials and tools. Purposeful stupidity is contrary to human nature.
He frequently needs pressure, stimulation or assurance, and information and
suggestions regarding feasible methods of simple sabotage.(1)Personal Motives(a) The ordinary citizen very probably has no immediate personal motive for
committing simple sabotage. Instead, he must be made to anticipate indirect
personal gain, such as might come with enemy evacuation or destruction of the
ruling government group. Gains should be stated as specifically as possible for
the area addressed: simple sabotage will hasten the day when Commissioner X and
his deputies Y and Z will be thrown out, when particularly obnoxious decrees
and restrictions will be abolished, when food will arrive, and so on. Abstract

Walt Whitmanhas somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies
to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as
to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by
allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
proper thing to love them. And in the sect—fairly large and yet
unusually choice—of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be
found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour ofNorthanger
Abbey,its completeness, finish, andentrain,obscure the undoubted
critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
difficulty.Persuasion,relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe ofMansfield Parkis admittedly
theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost{x}wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might
very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and
others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it.Sense and
Sensibilityhas perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
not want them.
I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes
would, all things considered, be divided betweenEmmaand the present
book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss
Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge
of vulgarity) would go forEmma.It is the larger, the more varied, the
more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather
more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most
peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the
Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,
I, for my part, declare forPride and Prejudiceunhesitatingly. It
seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most
eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention
in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show
cause.
In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the
reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and
finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in{xi}this
combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the
critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct
superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it
possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost
regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident
could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia
and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, acoup de
théâtre;it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the
story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.
All the minor passages—the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.
Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour—fit in after the
same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the
hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between
Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the
intrigue ofEmma,but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think
the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen
always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her
opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to
be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly
natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given
by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from
the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive
aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of
the playwright has ever been laid uponPride and Prejudice;and I dare
say that,{xii}if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and
delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would
certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,
which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can
avail himself, appear at once on the stage.
I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to
more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest
merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts
and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it
will sometimes mar those graces—appreciably, though not quite
consciously—to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built
novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which
displayed consummate command of dialogue—perhaps the rarest of all
faculties—would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot
acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the
ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one
should putPride and Prejudicefar lower if it did not contain what
seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her
faculty of character-creation—masterpieces who may indeed admit John
Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,
but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still
superior to them.
The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate
that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to
express, and at any particular{xiii}time likely to be differently
apprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a
greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of
the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of
scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,
obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,
for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in
Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was
masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of
common subdivisions of quality—demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,
avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a
certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those
who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the
savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness
of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that
her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much
protest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a
restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in
roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,
of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early"

*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND ***
CHAPTER I.Down the Rabbit-HoleAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and
of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister
was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is
the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or
conversations?”So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day
made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a
daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing soveryremarkable in that; nor did Alice think it soverymuch out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actuallytook a watch out of its
waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a
rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was
just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the
world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped
suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping
herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of
time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen
next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it
was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there
she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the
shelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to
her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for
fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this,
I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all
think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell
off the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)Down, down, down. Would the fallnevercome to an end? “I wonder
how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I
must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had
learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
this was not averygood opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as
there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)
“—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I
wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no idea
what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words
to say.)Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall rightthroughthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was
rather glad therewasno one listening, this time, as it didn’t
sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what
the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand
or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancycurtseyingas you’re falling through the air! Do you think you
could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me
for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up
somewhere.”Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking
again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”
(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice
in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very
like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alice
began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do
bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either
question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she
was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand
with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the
truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down she
came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she
looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,
and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a
moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear
it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how late
it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner,
but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,
which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice
had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she
walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;
there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first
thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it
would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a
low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about
fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her
great delight it fitted!Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much
larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the
loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and
wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head
would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little
use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I
think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many
out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that
very few things indeed were really impossible.There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to
the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book
of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little
bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,)
and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK
ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice
was not going to dothatin a hurry. “No, I’ll look
first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked
‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little
histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and
other unpleasant things, all because theywouldnot remember the simple
rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn
you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your fingerverydeeply
with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink
much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to
disagree with you, sooner or later.However, this bottle wasnotmarked “poison,” so Alice
ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of
mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.*      *      *      *      *      *      **      *      *      *      *      **      *      *      *      *      *      *“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up
like a telescope.”And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened
up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little
door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to
see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a "

IIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in father’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said, “Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighbourhood.And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.” This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month.Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.Her husband,"

A DOLL’S HOUSE
ACT I[SCENE.—A room furnished comfortably and tastefully, but not
extravagantly. At the back, a door to the right leads to the entrance-hall,
another to the left leads to Helmer’s study. Between the doors stands a
piano. In the middle of the left-hand wall is a door, and beyond it a window.
Near the window are a round table, arm-chairs and a small sofa. In the
right-hand wall, at the farther end, another door; and on the same side, nearer
the footlights, a stove, two easy chairs and a rocking-chair; between the stove
and the door, a small table. Engravings on the walls; a cabinet with china and
other small objects; a small book-case with well-bound books. The floors are
carpeted, and a fire burns in the stove. It is winter.A bell rings in the hall; shortly afterwards the door is heard to open.
Enter NORA, humming a tune and in high spirits. She is in outdoor dress and
carries a number of parcels; these she lays on the table to the right. She
leaves the outer door open after her, and through it is seen a PORTER who is
carrying a Christmas Tree and a basket, which he gives to the MAID who has
opened the door.]NORA.Hide the Christmas Tree carefully, Helen. Be sure the children do not see it
until this evening, when it is dressed.[To the PORTER, taking out her
purse.]How much?PORTER.Sixpence.NORA.There is a shilling. No, keep the change.[The PORTER thanks her, and goes
out. NORA shuts the door. She is laughing to herself, as she takes off her hat
and coat. She takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two;
then goes cautiously to her husband’s door and listens.]Yes, he is
in.[Still humming, she goes to the table on the right.]HELMER.[calls out from his room]. Is that my little lark twittering out there?NORA.[busy opening some of the parcels]. Yes, it is!HELMER.Is it my little squirrel bustling about?NORA.Yes!HELMER.When did my squirrel come home?NORA.Just now.[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
mouth.]Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.HELMER.Don’t disturb me.[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
the room, pen in hand.]Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
little spendthrift been wasting money again?NORA.Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little. This is
the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.HELMER.Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.NORA.Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots of
money.HELMER.Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the salary
is due.NORA.Pooh! we can borrow until then.HELMER.Nora![Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]The same
little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today, and you
spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year’s Eve a slate
fell on my head and killed me, and—NORA.[putting her hands over his mouth]. Oh! don’t say such horrid
things.HELMER.Still, suppose that happened,—what then?NORA.If that were to happen, I don’t suppose I should care whether I owed
money or not.HELMER.Yes, but what about the people who had lent it?NORA.They? Who would bother about them? I should not know who they were.HELMER.That is like a woman! But seriously, Nora, you know what I think about that. No
debt, no borrowing. There can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that
depends on borrowing and debt. We two have kept bravely on the straight road so
far, and we will go on the same way for the short time longer that there need
be any struggle.NORA.[moving towards the stove]. As you please, Torvald.HELMER.[following her]. Come, come, my little skylark must not droop her wings.
What is this! Is my little squirrel out of temper?[Taking out his
purse.]Nora, what do you think I have got here?NORA.[turning round quickly]. Money!HELMER.There you are.[Gives her some money.]Do you think I don’t know
what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at Christmas-time?NORA.[counting]. Ten shillings—a pound—two pounds! Thank you,
thank you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time.HELMER.Indeed it must.NORA.Yes, yes, it will. But come here and let me show you what I have bought. And
all so cheap! Look, here is a new suit for Ivar, and a sword; and a horse and a
trumpet for Bob; and a doll and dolly’s bedstead for Emmy,—they are
very plain, but anyway she will soon break them in pieces. And here are
dress-lengths and handkerchiefs for the maids; old Anne ought really to have
something better.HELMER.And what is in this parcel?NORA.[crying out]. No, no! you mustn’t see that until this evening.HELMER.Very well. But now tell me, you extravagant little person, what would you like
for yourself?NORA.For myself? Oh, I am sure I don’t want anything.HELMER.Yes, but you must. Tell me something reasonable that you would particularly
like to have.NORA.No, I really can’t think of anything—unless, Torvald—HELMER.Well?NORA.[playing with his coat buttons, and without raising her eyes to his]. If
you really want to give me something, you might—you might—HELMER.Well, out with it!NORA.[speaking quickly]. You might give me money, Torvald. Only just as much
as you can afford; and then one of these days I will buy something with it.HELMER.But, Nora—NORA.Oh, do! dear Torvald; please, please do! Then I will wrap it up in beautiful
gilt paper and hang it on the Christmas Tree. Wouldn’t that be fun?HELMER.What are little people called that are always wasting money?NORA.Spendthrifts—I know. Let us do as you suggest, Torvald, and then I shall
have time to think what I am most in want of. That is a very sensible plan,
isn’t it?HELMER.[smiling]. Indeed it is—that is to say, if you were really to save
out of the money I give you, and then really buy something for yourself. But if
you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of unnecessary things, then
I merely have to pay up again.NORA.Oh but, Torvald—HELMER.You can’t deny it, my dear little Nora.[Puts his arm round her
waist.]It’s a sweet little spendthrift, but she uses up a deal of
money. One would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are!NORA.It’s a shame to say that. I do really save all I can.HELMER.[laughing]. That’s very true,—all you can. But you
can’t save anything!NORA.[smiling quietly and happily]. You haven’t any idea how many
expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.HELMER.You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always find some new way
of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have got it, it seems to melt
in your hands. You never know where it has gone. Still, one must take you as
you are. It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these
things, Nora.NORA.Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa’s qualities.HELMER.And I would not wish you to be anything but just what you are, my sweet little
skylark. But, do you know, it strikes me that you are looking rather—what
shall I say—rather uneasy today?NORA.Do I?HELMER.You do, really. Look straight at me.NORA.[looks at him]. Well?HELMER.[wagging his finger at her]. Hasn’t Miss Sweet Tooth been breaking
rules in town today?NORA.No; what makes you think that?HELMER.Hasn’t she paid a visit to the confectioner’s?NORA.No, I assure you, Torvald—HELMER.Not been nibbling sweets?NORA.No, certainly not.HELMER.Not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two?NORA.No, Torvald, I assure you really—HELMER.There, there, of course I was only joking.NORA.[going to the table on the right]. I should not think of going against
your wishes.HELMER.No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word—[Going up to
her.]Keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, my darling. They will
all be revealed tonight when the Christmas Tree is lit, no doubt.NORA.Did you remember to invite Doctor Rank?HELMER.No. But there is no need; as a matter of course he will come to dinner with us.
However, I will ask him when he comes in this morning. I have ordered some good
wine. Nora, you can’t think how I am looking forward to this evening.NORA.So am I! And how the children will enjoy themselves, Torvald!HELMER.It is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe appointment, and a big
enough income. It’s delightful to think of, isn’t it?NORA.It’s wonderful!HELMER.Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks beforehand you shut
yourself up every evening until long after midnight, making ornaments for the
Christmas Tree, and all the other fine things that were to be a surprise to us.
It was the dullest three weeks I ever spent!NORA.I didn’t find it dull.HELMER.[smiling]. But there was precious little result, Nora.NORA.Oh, you shouldn’t tease me about that again. How could I help the
cat’s going in and tearing everything to pieces?HELMER.Of cours"

THE SONNETS1From fairest creatures we desire increase,That thereby beauty’s rose might never die,But as the riper should by time decease,His tender heir might bear his memory:But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,Feed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,Making a famine where abundance lies,Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:Thou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,And only herald to the gaudy spring,Within thine own bud buriest thy content,And, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:Pity the world, or else this glutton be,To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.2When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,Thy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,Will be a tattered weed of small worth held:Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.How much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,If thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mineShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’Proving his beauty by succession thine.This were to be new made when thou art old,And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.3Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,Now is the time that face should form another,Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.For where is she so fair whose uneared wombDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?Or who is he so fond will be the tombOf his self-love to stop posterity?Thou art thy mother’s glass and she in theeCalls back the lovely April of her prime,So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.But if thou live remembered not to be,Die single and thine image dies with thee.4Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,Upon thyself thy beauty’s legacy?Nature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,And being frank she lends to those are free:Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,The bounteous largess given thee to give?Profitless usurer why dost thou useSo great a sum of sums yet canst not live?For having traffic with thyself alone,Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,What acceptable audit canst thou leave?Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,Which used lives th’ executor to be.5Those hours that with gentle work did frameThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwellWill play the tyrants to the very same,And that unfair which fairly doth excel:For never-resting time leads summer onTo hideous winter and confounds him there,Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:Then were not summer’s distillation leftA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.6Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface,In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,With beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:That use is not forbidden usury,Which happies those that pay the willing loan;That’s for thyself to breed another thee,Or ten times happier be it ten for one,Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,Leaving thee living in posterity?Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.7Lo in the orient when the gracious lightLifts up his burning head, each under eyeDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,Serving with looks his sacred majesty,And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,Resembling strong youth in his middle age,Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,Attending on his golden pilgrimage:But when from highmost pitch with weary car,Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,The eyes (fore duteous) now converted areFrom his low tract and look another way:So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon:Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.8Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,By unions married do offend thine ear,They do but sweetly chide thee, who confoundsIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:Mark how one string sweet husband to another,Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove none’.9Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,That thou consum’st thyself in single life?Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,The world will wail thee like a makeless wife,The world will be thy widow and still weep,That thou no form of thee hast left behind,When every private widow well may keep,By children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:Look what an unthrift in the world doth spendShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;But beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,And kept unused the user so destroys it:No love toward others in that bosom sitsThat on himself such murd’rous shame commits.10For shame deny that thou bear’st love to anyWho for thyself art so unprovident.Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,But that thou none lov’st is most evident:For thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate,That ’gainst thyself thou stick’st not to conspire,Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinateWhich to repair should be thy chief desire:O change thy thought, that I may change my mind,Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove,Make thee another self for love of me,That beauty still may live in thine or thee.11As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st,In one of thine, from that which thou departest,And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,Without this folly, age, and cold decay,If all were minded so, the times should cease,And threescore year would make the world away:Let those whom nature hath not made for store,Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.12When I do count the clock that tells the time,And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,When I behold the violet past prime,And sable curls all silvered o’er with white:When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,Which erst from heat did canopy the herdAnd summer’s green all girded up in sheavesBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard:Then of thy beauty do I question makeThat thou among the wastes of time must go,Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,And die as fast as they see others grow,And nothing ’gainst Time’s scythe can make defenceSave breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.13O that you were your self, but love you areNo longer yours, than you yourself here live,Against this coming end you should prepare,And your sweet semblance to some other give.So should that beauty which you hold in leaseFind no determination, then you wereYourself again after yourself’s decease,When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,Which husbandry in honour might uphold,Against the stormy gusts of winter’s dayAnd barren rage of death’s eternal cold?O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,You had a father, let your son say so.14Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck,And yet methinks I have astronomy,But not to tell of good, or e"

PRELUDE.Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious mixture
behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt, at least briefly,
on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with some gentleness at the
thought of the little girl walking forth one morning hand-in-hand with her
still smaller brother, to go and seek martyrdom in the country of the Moors?
Out they toddled from rugged Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two
fawns, but with human hearts, already beating to a national idea; until
domestic reality met them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from
their great resolve. That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa’s
passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed romances
of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to her? Her flame
quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within, soared after some
illimitable satisfaction, some object which would never justify weariness,
which would reconcile self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life
beyond self. She found her epos in the reform of a religious order.That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not the
last of her kind. Many Theresas have been born who found for themselves no epic
life wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps
only a life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur
ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which
found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled
circumstance they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but
after all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and
formlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent social
faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge for the ardently
willing soul. Their ardor alternated between a vague ideal and the common
yearning of womanhood; so that the one was disapproved as extravagance, and the
other condemned as a lapse.Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient
indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures of women:
if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as the ability to
count three and no more, the social lot of women might be treated with
scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness remains, and the limits of
variation are really much wider than any one would imagine from the sameness of
women’s coiffure and the favorite love-stories in prose and verse. Here and
there a cygnet is reared uneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and
never finds the living stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind. Here
and there is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving
heart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are dispersed
among hindrances, instead of centring in some long-recognizable deed.

BOOK I.MISS BROOKE.
CHAPTER I.Since I can do no good because a woman,Reach constantly at something that is near it.—The Maid’s Tragedy:BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by
poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear
sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared
to Italian painters; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed
to gain the more dignity from her plain garments, which by the side of
provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the
Bible,—or from one of our elder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day’s newspaper.
She was usually spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition
that her sister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely
more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress differed from
her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its arrangements; for Miss
Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed conditions, in most of which her
sister shared. The pride of being ladies had something to do with it: the
Brooke connections, though not exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably
“good:” if you inquired backward for a generation or two, you would not find
any yard-measuring or parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral
or a clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan
gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and managed to
come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a respectable family
estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet country-house, and
attending a village church hardly larger than a parlor, naturally regarded
frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s daughter. Then there was well-bred
economy, which in those days made show in dress the first item to be deducted
from, when any margin was required for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such
reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from
religious feeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have
determined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s sentiments, only
infusing them with that common-sense which is able to accept momentous
doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea knew many passages of
Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart; and to her the destinies of
mankind, seen by the light of Christianity, made the solicitudes of feminine
fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties
of a spiritual life involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in
gimp and artificial protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned
by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might frankly
include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there; she was
enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing whatever seemed to
her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom, to make retractations, and
then to incur martyrdom after all in a quarter where she had"

PART ONE
Chapter IThe Bertolini“The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no business at
all. She promised us south rooms with a view close together, instead of which
here are north rooms, looking into a courtyard, and a long way apart. Oh,
Lucy!”“And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by the
Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at the two rows
of English people who were sitting at the table; at the row of white bottles of
water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people; at the
portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the
English people, heavily framed; at the notice of the English church (Rev.
Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.), that was the only other decoration of the wall.
“Charlotte, don’t you feel, too, that we might be in London? I can hardly
believe that all kinds of other things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s
being so tired.”“This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying down her
fork.“I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter
would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to do it at all.
Oh, it is a shame!”“Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard that
you shouldn’t have a view.”Lucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me: of
course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first vacant room
in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part of whose
travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of generosity to
which she made many a tactful allusion.“No, no. You must have it.”“I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”“She would never forgiveme.”The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a
little peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness they
wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one of
them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant
forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He said:“I have a view, I have a view.”Miss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them over for
a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that they would “do”
till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was ill-bred, even before she
glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy build, with a fair, shaven face and
large eyes. There was something childish in those eyes, though it was not the
childishness of senility. What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to
consider, for her glance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her.
He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the
swim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then said: “A
view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”“This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view too.”“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll have
yours. We’ll change.”The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with the
new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as possible,
and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the question.”“Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”“You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again repressed
her.“But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And he
thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son, saying,
“George, persuade them!”“It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s nothing
else to say.”He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed and
sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in for what is
known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these
ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not
with rooms and views, but with—well, with something quite different,
whose existence she had not realized before. Now the old man attacked Miss
Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not change? What possible objection
had she? They would clear out in half an hour.Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was powerless
in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any one so gross. Her
face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as much as to say, “Are you
all like this?” And two little old ladies, who were sitting further up the
table, with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs, looked back, clearly
indicating “We are not; we are genteel.”“Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with the meat
that she had once censured.Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.“Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will make a
change.”Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The curtains
at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout but attractive,
who hurried forward to take his place at the table, cheerfully apologizing for
his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired decency, at once rose to her feet,
exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s Mr. Beebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh,
Charlotte, we must stop now, however bad the rooms are. Oh!”Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint:“How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss Bartlett
and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of
St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember the ladies
quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward pleasantly enough
and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy.“Iamso glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of
spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin
had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer Street, too, makes
it so specially funny.”“Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss Bartlett,
filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation
that you have just accepted the living—”“Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t know that I knew you at
Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe is—’”“Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer Street
next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood.”“Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe bowed.“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not often we get
him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”“Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.”“I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.”He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than to Miss
Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the girl whether she
knew Florence well, and was informed at some length that she had never been
there before. It is delightful to advise a newcomer, and he was first in the
field. “Don’t neglect the country round,” his advice concluded. “The first fine
afternoon drive up to Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that
sort.”“No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are wrong. The
first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”“That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We are in
luck.”And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People told them
what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to get rid of
the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how much the place would
grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had decided, almost enthusiastically,
that they would do. Whichever way they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted
at them. And above all rose the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato"

""Christmaswon't be Christmas without any 
presents,"" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug.
""It's so dreadful to be poor!"" sighed Meg, looking down at her
old dress.
""I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty
things, and other girls nothing at all,"" added little Amy, with an
injured sniff.
""We've got father and mother and each other,"" said Beth contentedly,
from her corner.
The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the
cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly,—
""We haven't got father, and shall not have him for a long time.""
She didn't say ""perhaps never,"" but each silently added it, thinking
of father far away, where the fighting was.
Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,—
""You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents
this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every
one; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when
our men are suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can
make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid
I don't;"" and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all
the pretty things she wanted.
""But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good.
We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by
our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you,
but I do want to buy Undine and Sintram for myself; I've wanted itsolong,"" said Jo, who was a bookworm.
""I planned to spend mine in new music,"" said Beth, with a little
sigh, which no one heard but the hearth-brush and kettle-holder.
""I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing-pencils; I really need
them,"" said Amy decidedly.
""Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish
us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a
little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,"" cried Jo, examining
the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.
""I knowIdo,—teaching those tiresome children nearly all day,
when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home,"" began Meg, in the complaining
tone again.
""You don't have half such a hard time as I do,"" said Jo.
""How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy
old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you
till you're ready to fly out of the window or cry?""
""It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping
things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and
my hands get so stiff, I can't practise well at all;"" and Beth looked
at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.
""I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,"" cried Amy; ""for you
don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if
you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label
your father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't
nice.""
""If you meanlibel, I'd say so, and not talk aboutlabels, as if papa was a pickle-bottle,"" advised Jo, laughing.
""I know what I mean, and you needn't bestatiricalabout it. It's proper to use good words, and improve yourvocabilary,"" 
returned Amy, with dignity.
""Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the
money papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and
good we'd be, if we had no worries!"" said Meg, who could remember
better times.
""You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than
the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in
spite of their money.""
""So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to
work, we make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would
say.""
""Jo does use such slang words!"" observed Amy, with a reproving
look at the long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up,
put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.
""Don't, Jo; it's so boyish!""
""That's why I do it.""
""I detest rude, unlady-like girls!""
""I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!""
""'Birds in their little nests agree,'"" sang Beth, the peace-maker,
with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and
the ""pecking"" ended for that time.
""Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,"" said Meg, beginning to
lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. ""You are old enough to leave
off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter
so much when you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn
up your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.""
""I'm not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it
in two tails till I'm twenty,"" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking
down a chestnut mane. ""I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be
Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster!
It's bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and
work and manners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being
a boy; and it's worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight
with papa, and I can only stay at home and knit, like a poky old
woman!"" And Jo shook the blue army-sock till the needles rattled
like castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.
""Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped; so you must try
to be contented with making your name boyish, and playing brother
to us girls,"" said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a
hand that all the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not
make ungentle in its touch.
""As for you, Amy,"" continued Meg, ""you are altogether too particular
and prim. Your airs are funny now; but you'll grow up an
affected little goose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners
and refined ways of speaking, when you don't try to be elegant; but
your absurd words are as bad as Jo's slang.""
""If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?"" asked
Beth, ready to share the lecture.
""You're a dear, and nothing else,"" answered Meg warmly; and
no one contradicted her, for the ""Mouse"" was the pet of the
family.
As young readers like to know ""how people look,"" we will take this
moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat knitting
away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly without,
and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable old
room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for a
good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,
chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and
a pleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it.
Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being
plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet
mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old
Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for
she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were
very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose,
and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by
turns fierce, funny, or though"

FIRST ACTSCENEMorning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is
luxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard in the
adjoining room.[Laneis arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music
has ceased,Algernonenters.]ALGERNON.Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?LANE.I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.ALGERNON.I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play
accurately—any one can play accurately—but I play with wonderful
expression. As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep
science for Life.LANE.Yes, sir.ALGERNON.And, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut
for Lady Bracknell?LANE.Yes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]ALGERNON.[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the way,
Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord Shoreman and Mr.
Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having
been consumed.LANE.Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.ALGERNON.Why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably
drink the champagne? I ask merely for information.LANE.I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often observed
that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.ALGERNON.Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?LANE.I believe itisa very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little
experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married once. That
was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.ALGERNON.[Languidly.] I don’t know that I am much interested in your family
life, Lane.LANE.No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it myself.ALGERNON.Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.LANE.Thank you, sir. [Lanegoes out.]ALGERNON.Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders
don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They seem,
as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.[EnterLane.]LANE.Mr. Ernest Worthing.[EnterJack.][Lanegoes out.]ALGERNON.How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?JACK.Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as usual, I
see, Algy!ALGERNON.[Stiffly.] I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight
refreshment at five o’clock. Where have you been since last Thursday?JACK.[Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.ALGERNON.What on earth do you do there?JACK.[Pulling off his gloves.] When one is in town one amuses oneself. When
one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively boring.ALGERNON.And who are the people you amuse?JACK.[Airily.] Oh, neighbours, neighbours.ALGERNON.Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?JACK.Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.ALGERNON.How immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By the way,
Shropshire is your county, is it not?JACK.Eh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber
sandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is coming to
tea?ALGERNON.Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.JACK.How perfectly delightful!ALGERNON.Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite
approve of your being here.JACK.May I ask why?ALGERNON.My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful. It
is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.JACK.I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to propose to
her.ALGERNON.I thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.JACK.How utterly unromantic you are!ALGERNON.I really don’t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic to
be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. Why, one
may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over.
The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If ever I get married, I’ll
certainly try to forget the fact.JACK.I have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially invented
for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.ALGERNON.Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in
Heaven—[Jackputs out his hand to take a sandwich.Algernonat once interferes.] Please don’t touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are
ordered specially for Aunt Augusta. [Takes one and eats it.]JACK.Well, you have been eating them all the time.ALGERNON.That is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. [Takes plate from below.]
Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for Gwendolen. Gwendolen is
devoted to bread and butter.JACK.[Advancing to table and helping himself.] And very good bread and butter it is
too.ALGERNON.Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all. You
behave as if you were married to her already. You are not married to her
already, and I don’t think you ever will be.JACK.Why on earth do you say that?ALGERNON.Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with. Girls
don’t think it right.JACK.Oh, that is nonsense!ALGERNON.It isn’t. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number
of bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I
don’t give my consent.JACK.Your consent!ALGERNON.My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to marry
her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily. [Rings bell.]JACK.Cecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I
don’t know any one of the name of Cecily.[EnterLane.]ALGERNON.Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the last
time he dined here.LANE.Yes, sir. [Lanegoes out.]JACK.Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish to
goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland
Yard about it. I was very nearly offering a large reward.ALGERNON.Well, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard up.JACK.There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.[EnterLanewith the cigarette case on a salver.Algernontakes it at once.Lanegoes out.]ALGERNON.I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. [Opens case and
examines it.] However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the
inscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after all.JACK.Of course it’s mine. [Moving to him.] You have seen me with it a hundred
times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside. It is a
very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.ALGERNON.Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should read and
what one shouldn’t. More than half of modern culture depends on what one
shouldn’t read.JACK.I am quite aware of the fact, and I don’t propose to discuss modern
culture. It isn’t the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I
simply want my cigarette case back.ALGERNON.Yes; but this isn’t your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a present
from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t know any one
of that name.JACK.Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.ALGERNON.Your aunt!JACK.Yes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give it back
to me, Algy.ALGERNON.[Retreating to back of sofa.] But why does she call herself little Cecily if
she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? [Reading.] ‘From little
Cecily with her fondest love.’JACK.[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.] My dear fellow, what on earth is there
in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a matter that
surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You seem to think that
every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is absurd! For Heaven’s
sake give me back my cigarette case. [FollowsAlgernonround the room.]ALGERNON.Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? ‘From little Cecily, with
her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.’ There is no objection, I admit,
to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be,
should call her own "

THE PREFACEThe artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the
artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate into another
manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those
who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.
This is a fault.Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For
these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only
beauty.There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written,
or badly written. That is all.The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own
face in a glass.The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing
his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter
of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an
imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are
true can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an
artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The
artist can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist
instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.
From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the
musician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the
type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface
do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the
spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a
work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics
disagree, the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making
a useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a
useless thing is that one admires it intensely.All art is quite useless.OSCAR WILDE

CHAPTER I.The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer
wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door
the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the
pink-flowering thorn.From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying,
smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could
just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a
laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a
beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds
in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in
front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and
making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the
medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of
swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way
through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the
dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more
oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant
organ.In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length
portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it,
some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward,
whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public
excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully
mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed
about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed
his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain
some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,”
said Lord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the
Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there,
there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the
pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to
see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor is really the only place.”“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered,
tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at
him at Oxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the
thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his
heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow,
why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You do anything in
the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to
throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world
worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait
like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the
old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.”“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really
can’t exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it.”Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you
were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with
your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who
looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is
a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an intellectual expression
and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression
begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony
of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all
forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned
professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church.
But then in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the
age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a
natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious
young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really
fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless
beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers
to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our
intelligence. Don’t "

CHAPTER IIf it had not rained on a certain May morning
Valancy Stirling’s whole life would have been entirely different. She would
have gone, with the rest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington’s engagement picnic
and Dr. Trent would have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear
what happened to her because of it.Valancy wakened early, in the lifeless, hopeless hour just preceding dawn. She
had not slept very well. One does not sleep well, sometimes, when one is
twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community and connection where
the unmarried are simply those who have failed to get a man.Deerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless old
maidenhood. But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished a certain pitiful,
shamed, little hope that Romance would come her way yet—never, until this
wet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the fact that she was twenty-nine
and unsought by any man.Ay,therelay the sting. Valancy did not mind so much being an old maid.
After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn’t possibly be as dreadful as
being married to an Uncle Wellington or an Uncle Benjamin, or even an Uncle
Herbert. What hurt her was that she had never had a chance to be anything but
an old maid. No man had ever desired her.The tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly greying
darkness. She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted to, for two
reasons. She was afraid that crying might bring on another attack of that pain
around the heart. She had had a spell of it after she had got into
bed—rather worse than any she had had yet. And she was afraid her mother
would notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at her with minute, persistent,
mosquito-like questions regarding the cause thereof.“Suppose,” thought Valancy with a ghastly grin, “I answered with the plain
truth, ‘I am crying because I cannot get married.’ How horrified Mother would
be—though she is ashamed every day of her life of her old maid daughter.”But of course appearances should be kept up. “It is not,” Valancy could hear
her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, “it is notmaidenlyto
think aboutmen.”The thought of her mother’s expression made Valancy laugh—for she had a
sense of humour nobody in her clan suspected. For that matter, there were a
good many things about Valancy that nobody suspected. But her laughter was very
superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled, futile little figure,
listening to the rain pouring down outside and watching, with a sick distaste,
the chill, merciless light creeping into her ugly, sordid room.She knew the ugliness of that room by heart—knew it and hated it. The
yellow-painted floor, with one hideous, “hooked” rug by the bed, with a
grotesque, “hooked” dog on it, always grinning at her when she awoke; the
faded, dark-red paper; the ceiling discoloured by old leaks and crossed by
cracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; the brown-paper lambrequin with
purple roses on it; the spotted old looking-glass with the crack across it,
propped up on the inadequate dressing-table; the jar of ancient potpourri made
by her mother in her mythical honeymoon; the shell-covered box, with one burst
corner, which Cousin Stickles had made in her equally mythical girlhood; the
beaded pincushion with half its bead fringe gone; the one stiff, yellow chair;
the faded old motto, “Gone but not forgotten,” worked in coloured yarns about
Great-grand-mother Stirling’s grim old face; the old photographs of ancient
relatives long banished from the rooms below. There were only two pictures that
were not of relatives. One, an old chromo of a puppy sitting on a rainy
doorstep. That picture always made Valancy unhappy. That forlorn little dog
crouched on the doorstep in the driving rain! Why didn’tsome oneopen
the door and let him in? The other picture was a faded, passe-partouted
engraving of Queen Louise coming down a stairway, which Aunt Wellington had
lavishly given her on her tenth birthday. For nineteen years she had looked at
it and hated it, beautiful, smug, self-satisfied Queen Louise. But she never
dared destroy it or remove it. Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been
aghast, or, as Valancy irreverently expressed it in her thoughts, would have
had a fit.Every room in the house was ugly, of course. But downstairs appearances were
kept up somewhat. There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw. Valancy
sometimes felt that she could have done something for her room herself, even
without money, if she were permitted. But her mother had negatived every timid
suggestion and Valancy did not persist. Valancy never persisted. She was afraid
to. Her mother could not brook opposition. Mrs. Stirling would sulk for days if
offended, with the airs of an insulted duchess.The only thing Valancy liked about her room was that she could be alone there
at night to cry if she wanted to.But, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for nothing except
sleeping and dressing in, were ugly? Valancy was never permitted to stay alone
in her room for any other purpose. People who wanted to be alone, so Mrs.
Frederick Stirling and Cousin Stickles believed, could only want to be alone
for some sinister purpose. But her room in the Blue Castle was everything a
room should be.Valancy, so cowed and subdued and overridden and snubbed in real life, was wont
to let herself go rather splendidly in her day-dreams. Nobody in the Stirling
clan, or its ramifications, suspected this, least of all her mother and Cousin
Stickles. They never knew that Valancy had two homes—the ugly red brick
box of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue Castle in Spain. Valancy had lived
spiritually in the Blue Castle ever since she could remember. She had been a
very tiny child when she found herself possessed of it. Always, when she shut
her eyes, she could see it plainly, with its turrets and banners on the
pine-clad mountain height, wrapped in its faint, blue loveliness, against the
sunset skies of a fair and unknown land. Everything wonderful and beautiful was
in that castle. Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and
fire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps, with
great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up and down them;
courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell and nightingales sang
among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that reflected only handsome knights and
lovely women—herself the loveliest of all, for whose glance men died. All
that supported her through the boredom of her days was the hope of going on a
dream spree at night. Most, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of
horror if they had known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle.For one thing she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time. One who
wooed her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry and won her after
long devotion and many deeds of derring-do, and was wedded to her with pomp and
circumstance in the great, banner-hung chapel of the Blue Castle.At twelve, this lover was a fair lad with golden curls and heavenly blue eyes.
At fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still necessarily handsome. At
twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual. At twenty-five, he had a clean-cut
jaw, slightly grim, and a face strong and rugged rather than handsome. Valancy
never grew older than twenty-five in her Blue Castle, but recently—very
recently—her hero had had reddish, tawny hair, a twisted smile and a
mysterious past.I don’t say Valancy deliberately murdered these lovers as she outgrew them. One
simply faded away as another came. Things are very convenient in this respect
in Blue Castles.But, on this morning of her day of fate, Valancy could not find the key of her
Blue Castle. Reality pressed on her too hardly, barking at her heels like a
maddening little dog. She was twenty-nine, lonely, undesired,
ill-favoured—the only homely girl in a handsome clan, with no past and no
future. As far as she could look back, life was drab and colourless, with not
one single crimson or purple spot anywhere. As far as she could look forward"

Chapter 1It began in a Woman’s Club in London on a February afternoon—an uncomfortable
club, and a miserable afternoon—when Mrs. Wilkins, who had come down from
Hampstead to shop and had lunched at her club, took upThe Timesfrom
the table in the smoking-room, and running her listless eye down the Agony
Column saw this:To Those who Appreciate Wistaria and Sunshine. Small mediaeval Italian Castle
on the shores of the Mediterranean to be Let Furnished for the month of April.
Necessary servants remain. Z, Box 1000,The Times.That was its conception; yet, as in the case of many another, the conceiver was
unaware of it at the moment.So entirely unaware was Mrs. Wilkins that her April for that year had then and
there been settled for her that she dropped the newspaper with a gesture that
was both irritated and resigned, and went over to the window and stared
drearily out at the dripping street.Not for her were mediaeval castles, even those that are specially described as
small. Not for her the shores in April of the Mediterranean, and the wistaria
and sunshine. Such delights were only for the rich. Yet the advertisement had
been addressed to persons who appreciate these things, so that it had been,
anyhow, addressed too to her, for she certainly appreciated them; more than
anybody knew; more than she had ever told. But she was poor. In the whole world
she possessed of her very own only ninety pounds, saved from year to year, put
by carefully pound by pound, out of her dress allowance. She had scraped this
sum together at the suggestion of her husband as a shield and refuge against a
rainy day. Her dress allowance, given her by her father, was £100 a year, so
that Mrs. Wilkins’s clothes were what her husband, urging her to save, called
modest and becoming, and her acquaintance to each other, when they spoke of her
at all, which was seldom for she was very negligible, called a perfect sight.Mr. Wilkins, a solicitor, encouraged thrift, except that branch of it which got
into his food. He did not call that thrift, he called it bad housekeeping. But
for the thrift which, like moth, penetrated into Mrs. Wilkins’s clothes and
spoilt them, he had much praise. “You never know,” he said, “when there will be
a rainy day, and you may be very glad to find you have a nest-egg. Indeed we
both may.”Looking out of the club window into Shaftesbury Avenue—hers was an economical
club, but convenient for Hampstead, where she lived, and for Shoolbred’s, where
she shopped—Mrs. Wilkins, having stood there some time very drearily, her
mind’s eye on the Mediterranean in April, and the wistaria, and the enviable
opportunities of the rich, while her bodily eye watched the really extremely
horrible sooty rain falling steadily on the hurrying umbrellas and splashing
omnibuses, suddenly wondered whether perhaps this was not the rainy day
Mellersh—Mellersh was Mr. Wilkins—had so often encouraged her to prepare for,
and whether to get out of such a climate and into the small mediaeval castle
wasn’t perhaps what Providence had all along intended her to do with her
savings. Part of her savings, of course; perhaps quite a small part. The
castle, being mediaeval, might also be dilapidated, and dilapidations were
surely cheap. She wouldn’t in the least mind a few of them, because you didn’t
pay for dilapidations which were already there; on the contrary—by reducing the
price you had to pay they really paid you. But what nonsense to think of it . .
.She turned away from the window with the same gesture of mingled irritation and
resignation with which she had laid downThe Times, and crossed the room
towards the door with the intention of getting her mackintosh and umbrella and
fighting her way into one of the overcrowded omnibuses and going to Shoolbred’s
on her way home and buying some soles for Mellersh’s dinner—Mellersh was
difficult with fish and liked only soles, except salmon—when she beheld Mrs.
Arbuthnot, a woman she knew by sight as also living in Hampstead and belonging
to the club, sitting at the table in the middle of the room on which the
newspapers and magazines were kept, absorbed, in her turn, in the first page ofThe Times.Mrs. Wilkins had never yet spoken to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who belonged to one of the
various church sets, and who analysed, classified, divided and registered the
poor; whereas she and Mellersh, when they did go out, went to the parties of
impressionist painters, of whom in Hampstead there were many. Mellersh had a
sister who had married one of them and lived up on the Heath, and because of
this alliance Mrs. Wilkins was drawn into a circle which was highly unnatural
to her, and she had learned to dread pictures. She had to say things about
them, and she didn’t know what to say. She used to murmur, “Marvellous,” and
feel that it was not enough. But nobody minded. Nobody listened. Nobody took
any notice of Mrs. Wilkins. She was the kind of person who is not noticed at
parties. Her clothes, infested by thrift, made her practically invisible; her
face was non-arresting; her conversation was reluctant; she was shy. And if
one’s clothes and face and conversation are all negligible, thought Mrs.
Wilkins, who recognised her disabilities, what, at parties, is there left of
one?Also she was always with Wilkins, that clean-shaven, fine-looking man, who gave
a party, merely by coming to it, a great air. Wilkins was very respectable. He
was known to be highly thought of by his senior partners. His sister’s circle
admired him. He pronounced adequately intelligent judgments on art and artists.
He was pithy; he was prudent; he never said a word too much, nor, on the other
hand, did he ever say a word too little. He produced the impression of keeping
copies of everything he said; and he was so obviously reliable that it often
happened that people who met him at these parties became discontented with
their own solicitors, and after a period of restlessness extricated themselves
and went to Wilkins.Naturally Mrs. Wilkins was blotted out. “She,” said his sister, with something
herself of the judicial, the digested, and the final in her manner, “should
stay at home.” But Wilkins could not leave his wife at home. He was a family
solicitor, and all such have wives and show them. With his in the week he went
to parties, and with his on Sundays he went to church. Being still fairly
young—he was thirty-nine—and ambitious of old ladies, of whom he had not yet
acquired in his practice a sufficient number, he could not afford to miss
church, and it was there that Mrs. Wilkins became familiar, though never
through words, with Mrs. Arbuthnot.She saw her marshalling the children of the poor into pews. She would come in
at the head of the procession from the Sunday School exactly five minutes
before the choir, and get her boys and girls neatly fitted into their allotted
seats, and down on their little knees in their preliminary prayer, and up again
on their feet just as, to the swelling organ, the vestry door opened, and the
choir and clergy, big with the litanies and commandments they were presently to
roll out, emerged. She had a sad face, yet she was evidently efficient. The
combination used to make Mrs. Wilkins wonder, for she had been told by
Mellersh, on days when she had only been able to get plaice, that if one were
efficient one wouldn’t be depressed, and that if one does one’s job well one
becomes automatically bright and brisk.About Mrs. Arbuthnot there was nothing bright and brisk, though much in her way
with the Sunday School children that was automatic; but when Mrs. Wilkins,
turning from the window, caught sight of her in the club she was not being
automatic at all, but was looking fixedly at one portion of the first page ofThe Times, holding the paper quite still, her eyes not moving. She was
just staring; and her face, as usual, was the face of a patient and
disappointed Madonna.Obeying an impulse she wondered at even while obeying it, Mrs. Wilkins, the
shy and the reluctant, instead of proceeding as she had intended to the
cloakroom and from thence to Schoolbred’s in search of Mellersh’s fish,
stopped at the table and sat down exactly opposite Mrs. Arbuthnot, to whom
she had never yet spoken in her life.It was one of those long, narrow refectory tables, so that they were quite
close to each other.Mrs. Arbuthnot, however, did not look up. She continued to gaze, with eyes
that seemed to be dreaming, at one spot only of The Times.Mrs. Wilkins watched her a minute, trying to screw up courage to speak to her.
She wanted to ask her if she had seen the advertisement. She did not know why
she wanted to ask her this, but she wanted to. How stupid not to be able to
speak to her. She looked so kind. She looked so unhappy. Why couldn’t two
unhappy people "

*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE ***
STORY OF THE DOORMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never
lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward in
sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable. At friendly
meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something eminently human
beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never found its way into his
talk, but which spoke not only in these silent symbols of the after-dinner
face, but more often and loudly in the acts of his life. He was austere with
himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and
though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty
years. But he had an approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost
with envy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in
any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to
Cain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go
to the devil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his
fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in
the lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about
his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative at the
best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar catholicity of
good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his friendly circle
ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was the lawyer’s way.
His friends were those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest;
his affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no aptness in
the object. Hence, no doubt the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield,
his distant kinsman, the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for
many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they could find
in common. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks,
that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with obvious
relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put the greatest
store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel of each week, and not
only set aside occasions of pleasure, but even resisted the calls of business,
that they might enjoy them uninterrupted.It chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a by-street in
a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is called quiet, but it
drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The inhabitants were all doing well, it
seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out the surplus
of their grains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that
thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even
on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of
passage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a
fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses,
and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the
eye of the passenger.Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was broken by
the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain sinister block of
building thrust forward its gable on the street. It was two storeys high;
showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower storey and a blind forehead
of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of
prolonged and sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell
nor knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and
struck matches on the panels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy
had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had
appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages.Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but when
they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed.“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion
had replied in the affirmative, “It is connected in my mind,” added
he, “with a very odd story.”“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice,
“and what was that?”“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming
home from some place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a
black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was
literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the folks
asleep—street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all
as empty as a church—till at last I got into that state of mind when a
man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at
once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a
good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard
as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another
naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing;
for the man trampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming
on the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It
wasn’t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few
halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where
there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was perfectly
cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out
the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were the
girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been
sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more
frightened, according to the sawbones; and there you might have supposed would
be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing
to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child’s family, which was only
natural. But the doctor’s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut
and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh
accent and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of
us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones turn sick and
white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew
what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best.
We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this as should
make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends
or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we
were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could
for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such hateful faces;
and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering
coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying it off, sir,
really like Satan. ‘If you choose to make capital out of this
accident,’ said he, ‘I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but
wishes to avoid a scene,’ says he. ‘Name your figure.’ Well,
we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child’s family; he would
have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us
that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get the
money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the
door?—whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter
of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts’s, drawn
payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can’t mention, though
it’s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well
known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for
more than that if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my
gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not,
in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out with
another man’s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite
easy and sneering. ‘Set your mind at rest,’ says he, ‘I will
stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.’ So we all
set off, the doctor, and the child’s father, and our friend and myself,
and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had
breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said
I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was
genuine.”“Tut-tut!” said Mr. Utterson.“I see you feel as I do,” said Mr. Enfield. “Yes, it’s
a bad story. For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a
really damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of
the proprieties, celebrated"

It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure
ancestral halls for the summer.
A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach
the height of romantic felicity—but that would be asking too much of
fate!
Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.
Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted?
John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.
John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an intense
horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be
felt and seen and put down in figures.
John is a physician, andperhaps—(I would not say it to a living
soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my
mind)—perhapsthat is one reason I do not get well faster.
You see, he does not believe I am sick!
And what can one do?
If a physician of high standing, and one’s own husband, assures friends
and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary
nervous depression—a slight hysterical tendency—what is one to do?
My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the same
thing.
So I take phosphates or phosphites—whichever it is, and tonics, and
journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to
“work” until I am well again.
Personally, I disagree with their ideas.
Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do
me good.
But what is one to do?
I did write for a while in spite of them; but itdoesexhaust me a good
deal—having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.
I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more
society and stimulus—but John says the very worst thing I can do is to
think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.
So I will let it alone and talk about the house.
The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road,
quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English places that
you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of
separate little houses for the gardeners and people.
There is adeliciousgarden! I never saw such a garden—large and
shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors
with seats under them.
There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.
There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and
co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.
That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care—there is
something strange about the house—I can feel it.
I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was adraught, and shut the window.
I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I’m sure I never used to be
so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.
But John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains
to control myself,—before him, at least,—and that makes me very
tired.
I don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the
piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz
hangings! but John would not hear of it.
He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room
for him if he took another.
He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special
direction.
I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care from
me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.
He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and
all the air I could get. “Your exercise depends on your strength, my
dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat on your appetite; but air
you can absorb all the time.” So we took the nursery, at the top of the
house.
It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all
ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then playground and
gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and
there are rings and things in the walls.
The paint and paper look as if a boys’ school had used it. It is stripped
off—the paper—in great patches all around the head of my bed, about
as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low
down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.
One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin.
It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to
constantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame, uncertain
curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide—plunge off at
outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard-of contradictions.
The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow,
strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.
It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in others.
No wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to live in
this room long.
There comes John, and I must put this away,—he hates to have me write a
word.
We have been here two weeks, and I haven’t felt like writing before,
since that first day.
I am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is
nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength.
John is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.
I am glad my case is not serious!
But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.
John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is noreasonto suffer, and that satisfies him.
Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in
any way!
I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am
a comparative burden already!
Nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able—to
dress and entertain, and order things.
It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!
And yet Icannotbe with him, it makes me so nervous.
I suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about this
wallpaper!
At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was
letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous
patient than to give way to such fancies.
He said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead,
and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of the stairs, and
so on.
“You know the place is doing you good,” he said, “and really,
dear, I don’t care to renovate the house just for a three months’
rental.”
“Then do let us go downstairs,” I said, “there are such
pretty rooms there.”
Then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and said he
would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into the bargain.
But he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.
It is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of course, I
would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.
I’m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid paper.
Out of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded arbors,
the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.
Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf
belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there
from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these numerous paths and
arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He
says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous
weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I
ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.
I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would
relieve the press of ideas and rest me.
But I find I get pretty tired when I try.
It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work.
When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a
long visit; but he says he would as soon put fire-works in my pillow-case as to
let me have those stimulating people about now.
I wish I could get well faster.
But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if itknewwhat a vicious influence it had!
There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two
bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.
I get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness. Up
and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are
everywhere. There is one place where two breadths didn’t match, and the
eyes go all up and down the line, one a little higher than the other.
I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all know
how much expression they have! I used to lie awake a"

CHAPTER I.OUR SOCIETYIn the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the holders
of houses above a certain rent are women. If a married couple come to settle in
the town, somehow the gentleman disappears; he is either fairly frightened to
death by being the only man in the Cranford evening parties, or he is accounted
for by being with his regiment, his ship, or closely engaged in business all
the week in the great neighbouring commercial town of Drumble, distant only
twenty miles on a railroad. In short, whatever does become of the gentlemen,
they are not at Cranford. What could they do if they were there? The surgeon
has his round of thirty miles, and sleeps at Cranford; but every man cannot be
a surgeon. For keeping the trim gardens full of choice flowers without a weed
to speck them; for frightening away little boys who look wistfully at the said
flowers through the railings; for rushing out at the geese that occasionally
venture in to the gardens if the gates are left open; for deciding all
questions of literature and politics without troubling themselves with
unnecessary reasons or arguments; for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of
everybody’s affairs in the parish; for keeping their neat maid-servants in
admirable order; for kindness (somewhat dictatorial) to the poor, and real
tender good offices to each other whenever they are in distress, the ladies of
Cranford are quite sufficient. “A man,” as one of them observed to me once, “issoin the way in the house!” Although the ladies of Cranford know all
each other’s proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other’s
opinions. Indeed, as each has her own individuality, not to say eccentricity,
pretty strongly developed, nothing is so easy as verbal retaliation; but,
somehow, good-will reigns among them to a considerable degree.The Cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel, spirited out in a
few peppery words and angry jerks of the head; just enough to prevent the even
tenor of their lives from becoming too flat. Their dress is very independent of
fashion; as they observe, “What does it signify how we dress here at Cranford,
where everybody knows us?” And if they go from home, their reason is equally
cogent, “What does it signify how we dress here, where nobody knows us?” The
materials of their clothes are, in general, good and plain, and most of them
are nearly as scrupulous as Miss Tyler, of cleanly memory; but I will answer
for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England,
was seen in Cranford—and seen without a smile.I can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella, under which a gentle
little spinster, left alone of many brothers and sisters, used to patter to
church on rainy days. Have you any red silk umbrellas in London? We had a
tradition of the first that had ever been seen in Cranford; and the little boys
mobbed it, and called it “a stick in petticoats.” It might have been the very
red silk one I have described, held by a strong father over a troop of little
ones; the poor little lady—the survivor of all—could scarcely carry
it.Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls; and they were
announced to any young people who might be staying in the town, with all the
solemnity with which the old Manx laws were read once a year on the Tinwald
Mount.“Our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey to-night, my
dear” (fifteen miles in a gentleman’s carriage); “they will give you some rest
to-morrow, but the next day, I have no doubt, they will call; so be at liberty
after twelve—from twelve to three are our calling hours.”Then, after they had called—“It is the third day; I dare say your mamma has told you, my dear, never to let
more than three days elapse between receiving a call and returning it; and
also, that you are never to stay longer than a quarter of an hour.”“But am I to look at my watch? How am I to find out when a quarter of an hour
has passed?”“You must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not allow yourself to
forget it in conversation.”As everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received or paid a
call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about. We kept ourselves
to short sentences of small talk, and were punctual to our time.I imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor, and had some
difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were like the Spartans, and
concealed their smart under a smiling face. We none of us spoke of money,
because that subject savoured of commerce and trade, and though some might be
poor, we were all aristocratic. The Cranfordians had that kindlyesprit de
corpswhich made them overlook all deficiencies in success when some among
them tried to conceal their poverty. When Mrs Forrester, for instance, gave a
party in her baby-house of a dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the
ladies on the sofa by a request that she might get the tea-tray out from
underneath, everyone took this novel proceeding as the most natural thing in
the world, and talked on about household forms and ceremonies as if we all
believed that our hostess had a regular servants’ hall, second table, with
housekeeper and steward, instead of the one little charity-school maiden, whose
short ruddy arms could never have been strong enough to carry the tray
upstairs, if she had not been assisted in private by her mistress, who now sat
in state, pretending not to know what cakes were sent up, though she knew, and
we knew, and she knew that we knew, and we knew that she knew that we knew, she
had been busy all the morning making tea-bread and sponge-cakes.There were one or two consequences arising from this general but unacknowledged
poverty, and this very much acknowledged gentility, which were not amiss, and
which might be introduced into many circles of society to their great
improvement. For instance, the inhabitants of Cranford kept early hours, and
clattered home in their pattens, under the guidance of a lantern-bearer, about
nine o’clock at night; and the whole town was abed and asleep by half-past ten.
Moreover, it was considered “vulgar” (a tremendous word in Cranford) to give
anything expensive, in the way of eatable or drinkable, at the evening
entertainments. Wafer bread-and-butter and sponge-biscuits were all that the
Honourable Mrs Jamieson gave; and she was sister-in-law to the late Earl of
Glenmire, although she did practise such “elegant economy.”“Elegant economy!” How naturally one falls back into the phraseology of
Cranford! There, economy was always “elegant,” and money-spending always
“vulgar and ostentatious”; a sort of sour-grapeism which made us very peaceful
and satisfied. I never shall forget the dismay felt when a certain Captain
Brown came to live at Cranford, and openly spoke about his being poor—not
in a whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and windows being previously
closed, but in the public street! in a loud military voice! alleging his
poverty as a reason for not taking a particular house. The ladies of Cranford
were already rather moaning over the invasion of their territories by a man and
a gentleman. He"

INTRODUCTIONThe Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom, Smollett’s third novel, was given to
the world in 1753. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, writing to her daughter, the
Countess of Bute, over a year later [January 1st, 1755], remarked that “my
friend Smollett . . . has certainly a talent for invention, though I think it
flags a little in his last work.” Lady Mary was both right and wrong. The
inventive power which we commonly think of as Smollett’s was the ability to
work over his own experience into realistic fiction. Of this, Ferdinand Count
Fathom shows comparatively little. It shows relatively little, too, of
Smollett’s vigorous personality, which in his earlier works was present to give
life and interest to almost every chapter, were it to describe a street brawl,
a ludicrous situation, a whimsical character, or with venomous prejudice to
gibbet some enemy. This individuality—the peculiar spirit of the author
which can be felt rather than described—is present in the dedication of
Fathom to Doctor ———, who is no other than Smollett himself,
and a candid revelation of his character, by the way, this dedication contains.
It is present, too, in the opening chapters, which show, likewise, in the
picture of Fathom’s mother, something of the author’s peculiar “talent for
invention.” Subsequently, however, there is no denying that the Smollett
invention and the Smollett spirit both flag. And yet, in a way, Fathom displays
more invention than any of the author’s novels; it is based far less than any
other on personal experience. Unfortunately such thorough-going invention was
not suited to Smollett’s genius. The result is, that while uninteresting as a
novel of contemporary manners, Fathom has an interest of its own in that it
reveals a new side of its author. We think of Smollett, generally, as a
rambling storyteller, a rational, unromantic man of the world, who fills his
pages with his own oddly-metamorphosed acquaintances and experiences. The
Smollett of Count Fathom, on the contrary, is rather a forerunner of the
romantic school, who has created a tolerably organic tale of adventure out of
his own brain. Though this is notably less readable than the author’s earlier
works, still the wonder is that when the man is so far “off his beat,” he
should yet know so well how to meet the strange conditions which confront him.
To one whose idea of Smollett’s genius is formed entirely by Random and Pickle
and Humphry Clinker, Ferdinand Count Fathom will offer many surprises.The first of these is t"

*** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A MODEST PROPOSAL ***
It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town, or travel
in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and cabbin-doors crowded
with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six children, all
in rags, and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers, instead of
being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their
time in stroling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow
up, either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country,
to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.I think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of children in
the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of
their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom, a very great
additional grievance; and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and
easy method of making these children sound and useful members of the
commonwealth, would deserve so well of the publick, as to have his statue set
up for a preserver of the nation.But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the
children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and shall take
in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are born of parents in
effect as little able to support them, as those who demand our charity in the
streets.As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this
important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our projectors,
I have always found them grossly mistaken in their computation. It is true, a
child just dropt from its dam, may be supported by her milk, for a solar year,
with little other nourishment: at most not above the value of two shillings,
which the mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful
occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to
provide for them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their
parents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their
lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding, and partly to
the clothing of many thousands.There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent
those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their
bastard children, alas! too frequent among us, sacrificing the poor innocent
babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence than the shame, which would move
tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast.The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a
half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple,
whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty thousand couple,
who are able to maintain their own children, (although I apprehend there cannot
be so many under the present distresses of the kingdom) but this being
granted, there will remain a hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again
subtract fifty thousand, for those women who miscarry, or whose children die by
accident or disease within the year. There only remain a hundred and twenty
thousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore is, How
this number shall be reared and provided for? which, as I have already said,
under the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the
methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft or
agriculture; they neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor cultivate
land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at
six years old; except where they are of towardly parts, although I confess they
learn the rudiments much earlier; during which time they can however be
properly looked upon only as probationers; as I have been informed by a
principal gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never
knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the
kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl, before twelve years old,
is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this age, they will not
yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a crown at most, on the
exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the
charge of nutriments and rags having been at least four times that value.I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be
liable to the least objection.I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,
that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious
nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I
make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasee, or a ragoust.I do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the hundred
and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved
for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males; which is more than we
allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children
are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our
savages, therefore, one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the
remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the
persons of quality and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother
to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump, and
fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for
friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a
reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt, will be very good
boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.I have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12 pounds, and
in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28 pounds.I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for
landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem to have
the best title to the children.Infant’s flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful
in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave author, an
eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick dyet, there are more
children born in Roman Catholick countries about nine months after Lent,
than at any other season; therefore, reckoning a year after Lent, the
markets will be more glutted than usual, because the number of Popish infants,
is at least three to one in this kingdom, and therefore it will have one other
collateral advantage, by lessening the number of Papists among us.I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar’s child (in which
list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the farmers) to be
about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no gentleman would
repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child, which, as I
have said, will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat, when he hath only
some particular friend, or his own family to dine with him. Thus the squire
will learn to be a good landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the
mother will have eight shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she
produces another child.Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may flay the
carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make admirable gloves
for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.As to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose, in the
most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not be
wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and dressing
them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues I highly
esteem, was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter, to offer a refinement
upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this kingdom, having of late
destroyed their deer, he conceived that the want of venison might be well
supplied by the bodies of young lads and maidens, not exceeding fourteen years
of age, nor under twelve; so great a number of both sexes in every county
being now ready to starve for want of work and service: and these to be
disposed of by their parents if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations.
But with due deference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I
cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my American
acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their flesh was
generally tough and lean, like that of our schoolboys, by continual exercise,
and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them would not answer the charge.
Then as to the females, it would, I think, with humble submission, be a los"

CHAPTER IJONATHAN HARKER’S JOURNAL(Kept in shorthand.)3 May. Bistritz.—Left Munich at 8:35P. M., on 1st May, arriving at
Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
rule.We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
very good but thirsty. (Mem., get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a
national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the
British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was
not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post
town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter
here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my
travels with Mina.In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the
descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the
East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered
the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I
read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem., I
must ask the Count all about them.)I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had
all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my
window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous
knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour
which they said was “mamaliga,” and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
very excellent dish, which they call “impletata.” (Mem., get recipe
for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little
before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the
more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,
however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
self-assertion.It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier—for the
Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina—it has had a very stormy
existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
proper being assisted by famine and disease.Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress—white
undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She
smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
a letter:—“My Friend.—Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
start for Bukov"

RESPECTED SIR,
I have received your esteemed favour of the 13th ultimo, whereby it
      appeareth, that you have perused those same Letters, the which were
      delivered unto you by my friend, the reverend Mr Hugo Behn; and I am
      pleased to find you think they may be printed with a good prospect of
      success; in as much as the objections you mention, I humbly conceive, are
      such as may be redargued, if not entirely removed—And, first, in the
      first place, as touching what prosecutions may arise from printing the
      private correspondence of persons still living, give me leave, with all
      due submission, to observe, that the Letters in question were not written
      and sent under the seal of secrecy; that they have no tendency to the mala
      fama, or prejudice of any person whatsoever; but rather to the information
      and edification of mankind: so that it becometh a sort of duty to
      promulgate them in usum publicum. Besides, I have consulted Mr Davy
      Higgins, an eminent attorney of this place, who, after due inspection and
      consideration, declareth, That he doth not think the said Letters contain
      any matter which will be held actionable in the eye of the law. Finally,
      if you and I should come to a right understanding, I do declare in verbo
      sacerdotis, that, in case of any such prosecution, I will take the whole
      upon my own shoulders, even quoad fine and imprisonment, though, I must
      confess, I should not care to undergo flagellation: Tam ad turpitudinem,
      quam ad amaritudinem poenoe spectans—Secondly, concerning the
      personal resentment of Mr Justice Lismahago, I may say, non flocci facio—I
      would not willingly vilipend any Christian, if, peradventure, he deserveth
      that epithet: albeit, I am much surprised that more care is not taken to
      exclude from the commission all such vagrant foreigners as may be justly
      suspected of disaffection to our happy constitution, in church and state—God
      forbid that I should be so uncharitable, as to affirm, positively, that
      the said Lismahago is no better than a Jesuit in disguise; but this I will
      assert and maintain, totis viribus, that, from the day he qualified, he
      has never been once seen intra templi parietes, that is to say, within the
      parish church.
Thirdly, with respect to what passed at Mr Kendal’s table, when the said
      Lismahago was so brutal in his reprehensions, I must inform you, my good
      Sir, that I was obliged to retire, not by fear arising from his minatory
      reproaches, which, as I said above, I value not of a rush; but from the
      sudden effect produced, by a barbel’s row, which I had eaten at dinner,
      not knowing, that the said row is at certain seasons violently cathartic,
      as Galen observeth in his chapter Peri ichtos.
Fourthly, and lastly, with reference to the manner in which I got
      possession of these Letters, it is a circumstance that concerns my own
      conscience only; sufficeth it to say, I have fully satisfied the parties
      in whose custody they were; and, by this time, I hope I have also
      satisfied you in such ways, that the last hand may be put to our
      agreement, and the work proceed with all convenient expedition; in which I
      hope I rest,
Respected Sir, Your very humble servant,
JONATHAN DUSTWICH.
P.S. I propose, Deo volente, to have the pleasure of seeing you in the
      great city, towards All-hallowtide, when I shall be glad to treat with you
      concerning a parcel of MS. sermons, of a certain clergyman deceased; a
      cake of the right leaven, for the present taste of the public. Verbum
      sapienti, &c.
J.D.
I received yours in course of post, and shall be glad to treat with you
      for the M.S. which I have delivered to your friend Mr Behn; but can by no
      means comply with the terms proposed. Those things are so uncertain—Writing
      is all a lottery—I have been a loser by the works of the greatest
      men of the age—I could mention particulars, and name names; but
      don’t choose it—The taste of the town is so changeable. Then there
      have been so many letters upon travels lately published—What between
      Smollett’s, Sharp’s, Derrick’s, Thicknesse’s, Baltimore’s, and Baretti’s,
      together with Shandy’s Sentimental Travels, the public seems to be cloyed
      with that kind of entertainment—Nevertheless, I will, if you please,
      run the risque of printing and publishing, and you shall have half the
      profits of the impression—You need not take the trouble to bring up
      your sermons on my account—No body reads sermons but Methodists and
      Dissenters—Besides, for my own part, I am quite a stranger to that
      sort of reading; and the two persons, whose judgment I depended upon in
      those matters, are out of the way; one is gone abroad, carpenter of a man
      of war; and the other, has been silly enough to abscond, in order to avoid
      a prosecution for blasphemy—I’m a great loser by his going off—He
      has left a manual of devotion half finished on my hands, after having
      received money for the whole copy—He was the soundest divine, and
      had the most orthodox pen of all my people; and I never knew his judgment
      fail, but in flying from his bread and butter on this occasion.
By owning you was not put in bodily fear by Lismahago, you preclude
      yourself from the benefit of a good plea, over and above the advantage of
      binding him over. In the late war, I inserted in my evening paper, a
      paragraph that came by the post, reflecting upon the behaviour of a
      certain regiment in battle. An officer of said regiment came to my shop,
      and, in the presence of my wife and journeyman, threat"

THE HISTORY OF TOM JONES, A FOUNDLING.
BOOK I.— CONTAINING AS MUCH OF THE
      BIRTH OF THE FOUNDLING AS IS NECESSARY OR PROPER TO ACQUAINT THE READER
      WITH IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY.
Chapter i. — The introduction to the work,
      or bill of fare to the feast.
Chapter ii. — A short description of squire
      Allworthy, and a fuller account of Miss Bridget Allworthy, his sister.
Chapter iii. — An odd accident which befel
      Mr Allworthy at his return home. The decent behaviour of Mrs Deborah
      Wilkins, with some proper animadversions on bastards.
Chapter iv. — The reader's neck brought
      into danger by a description; his escape; and the great condescension of
      Miss Bridget Allworthy.
Chapter v. — Containing a few common
      matters, with a very uncommon observation upon them.
Chapter vi. — Mrs Deborah is introduced
      into the parish with a simile. A short account of Jenny Jones, with the
      difficulties and discouragements which may attend young women in the
      pursuit of learning.
Chapter vii. — Containing such grave
      matter, that the reader cannot laugh once through the whole chapter,

      the former.
Chapter ix. — Containing matters which will
      surprize the reader.

      MATRIMONIAL FELICITY IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF LIFE; AND VARIOUS OTHER
      TRANSACTIONS DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN CAPTAIN

MY LIFE
PART I1813-1842I was born at Leipzig on the 22nd of May 1813, in a room on the second floor of
the ‘Red and White Lion,’ and two days later was baptized at St. Thomas’s
Church, and christened Wilhelm Richard.My father, Friedrich Wagner, was at the time of my birth a clerk in the police
service at Leipzig, and hoped to get the post of Chief Constable in that town,
but he died in the October of that same year. His death was partly due to the
great exertions imposed upon him by the stress of police work during the war
troubles and the battle of Leipzig, and partly to the fact that he fell a
victim to the nervous fever which was raging at that time. As regards his
father’s position in life, I learnt later that he had held a small civil
appointment as toll collector at the Ranstädt Gate, but had distinguished
himself from those in the same station by giving his two sons a superior
education, my father, Friedrich, studying law, and the younger son, Adolph,
theology.My uncle subsequently exercised no small influence on my development; we shall
meet him again at a critical turning-point in the story of my youth.My father, whom I had lost so early, was, as I discovered afterwards, a great
lover of poetry and literature in general, and possessed in particular an
almost passionate affection for the drama, which was at that time much in vogue
among the educated classes. My mother told me, among other things, that he took
her to Lauchstadt for the first performance of theBraut von Messina,
and that on the promenade he pointed out Schiller and Goethe to her, and
reproved her warmly for never having heard of these great men. He is said to
have been not altogether free from a gallant interest in actresses. My mother
used to complain jokingly that she often had to keep lunch waiting for him
while he was paying court to a certain famous actress of the day.[1]When she scolded him, he vowed that he had
been delayed by papers that had to be attended to, and as a proof of his
assertion pointed to his fingers, which were supposed to be stained with ink,
but on closer inspection were found to be quite clean. His great fondness for
the theatre was further shown by his choice of the actor, Ludwig Geyer, as one
of his intimate friends. Although his choice of this friend was no doubt mainly
due to his love for the theatre, he at the same time introduced into his family
the noblest of benefactors; for this modest artist, prompted by a warm interest
in the lot of his friend’s large family, so unexpectedly left destitute,
devoted the remainder of his life to making strenuous efforts to maintain and
educate the orphans. Even when the police official was spending his evenings at
the theatre, the worthy actor generally filled his place in the family circle,
and it seems had frequently to appease my mother, who, rightly or wrongly,
complained of the frivolity of her husband.[1]Madame Hartwig.How deeply the homeless artist, hard pressed by life and tossed to and fro,
longed to feel himself at home in a sympathetic family circle, was proved by
the fact that a year after his friend’s death he married his widow, and from
that time forward became a most loving father to the seven children that had
been left behind.In this onerous undertaking he was favoured by an unexpected improvement in his
position, for he obtained a remunerative, respectable, and permanent
engagement, as a character actor, at the newly established Court Theatre in
Dresden. His talent for painting, which had already helped him to earn a
livelihood when forced by extreme poverty to break off his university studies,
again stood him in good stead in his position at Dresden. True, he complained
even more than his critics that he had been kept from a regular and systematic
study of this art, yet his extraordinary aptitude, for portrait painting in
particular, secured him such important commissions that he unfortunately
exhausted his strength prematurely by his twofold exertions as painter and
actor. Once, when he was invited to Munich to fulfil a temporary engagement at
the Court Theatre, he received, through the distinguished recommendation of the
Saxon Court, such pressing commissions from the Bavarian Court for portraits of
the royal family that he thought it wise to cancel his contract altogether. He
also had a turn for poetry. Besides fragments—often in very dainty verse—he
wrote several comedies, one of which,Der Bethlehemitische Kindermord, in
rhymed Alexandrines, was often performed; it was published and received the
warmest praise from Goethe.This excellent man, under whose care our family moved to Dresden when I was two
years old, and by whom my mother had another daughter, Cecilia, now also took
my education in hand with the greatest care and affection. He wished to adopt
me altogether, and accordingly, when I was sent to my first school, he gave me
his own name, so that till the age of fourteen I was known to my Dresden
schoolfellows as Richard Geyer; and it was not until some years after my
stepfather’s death, and on my family’s return to Leipzig, the home of my own
kith and kin, that I resumed the name of Wagner.The earliest recollections of my childhood are associated with my stepfather,
and passed from him to the theatre. I well remember that he would have liked to
see me develop a talent for painting; and his studio, with the "
